# How to Add Videos to This Property

## Quick Guide

1. **Place your video files** in this `videos/` folder
2. **Supported formats**: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`
3. **Videos will automatically appear** in the property gallery carousel

## Example Structure

```
videos/

```

## How It Works

- Videos are **automatically discovered** by the system
- They appear in the **Gallery carousel** alongside images
- Users can **play, pause, and control** the video using the built-in video controls
- Videos are displayed in **full width** with proper aspect ratio

## Video Recommendations

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec) is recommended for best browser compatibility
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **File Size**: Keep videos under 50MB for better loading performance
